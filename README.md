+ __Major__: Engaged in the development of large-scale service systems at Cainiao Group, Alibaba, with a focus on warehouse controll system(WCS).
+ __Interests__: I am involved in the reverse engineering of Windows system kernels and applications. My skills encompass shellcode injection and execution, memory read/write operations and hiding skills, and I have substantial experience in reverse engineering major game engines including Unreal, Unity and Chrome Engine.
+ __Open-Source__: I have limited open-source projects in my repository due to the inclusion of a large amount of code involving attacks on the Windows kernel and game applications, which is not suitable for public release. In the coming days, I might choose to open-source some low-threat code for sharing and discussion, such as test code related to Windows memory paging mechanisms.
+ __Language__: Java/C/C++/X86 ASM/Python/JavaSript
